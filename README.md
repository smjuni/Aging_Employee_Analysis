# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Module 7 - SQL

## Overview
The objective of this assignment is to help Pewlett-Hackard evaluate the amount of employees who will soon be retiring and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program in order to prepare for the "silver tsunami".

- In deliverable 1 our purpose is to identify the titles of the employees that are due to retire soon (born between 1952 and 1955) and to count the number of retiring employees currently in each title.

- In deliverable 2 our task is to identify which employees currently working at Pewlett-Hackard are eligible for a mentorship program. The eligibility requirements are that the employee is born in 1965. An additional requirement I used in this module is to ensure that the employees current title is listed in the database.

- The highest risk positions for retirement are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, with the assumption that they have been there the longest and are the best of their title.
